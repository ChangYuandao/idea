Task Type: Manipulation

Python environment: {task obs code string}
Task description: {task description}
Task goals: {task goal}
Observation keys: {keys}

Instructions:
1. Analyze the task and define metrics for comparison. Common metrics include:
   - Distances between robot manipulators (hands/fingers) and target objects.
   - Distances or orientations between objects and target positions.
   - Phase-specific metrics (e.g., before grasp, after grasp, during placement).
2. Treat each metric separately; do not combine unless explicitly defined.
3. Decompose the task into phases for more accurate evaluation.
4. Use only provided observation keys; do not create new keys.
5. Output a Python function comparing two trajectories and returning the label list.
