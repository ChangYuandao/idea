Task Type: Mobile Locomotion

Python environment: {task obs code string}
Task description: {task description}
Task goals: {task goal}
Observation keys: {keys}

Instructions:
1. Analyze the task and define metrics for comparison. Common metrics include:
   - Distance between robot center of mass (COM) and the goal.
   - Orientation or heading error.
   - Footstep stability or contact quality.
   - Velocity or energy efficiency.
2. Treat each metric separately; do not combine unless explicitly defined.
3. Decompose the task into phases if necessary (e.g., moving towards goal, reaching goal).
4. Use only provided observation keys; do not create new keys.
5. Output a Python function comparing two trajectories and returning the label list.
6. All data types used in the function are of numpy type, not tensor type.
7. In addition, use traj a[key][:,3] to get values instead of traj a[key][3], use the numerical distance metrics to compare between trajectories instead of use bool value, as directly judging success metric (success a = dist a < 0.2) at the start of the trajectory will always return False, resulting in invalid comparison.
